To use this SDK, one needs to have a Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 18.04. We have not verified on other platforms. The Shakti SDK user manual lists the procedure to program the shakti SoC on Digilent Arty-7 FPGA boards and use the Shakti SDK to write applications. We have also come up with a video tutorial to do the same.
