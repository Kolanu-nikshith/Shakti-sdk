The readme is a brief overview on how pwm based interrupt.

### OVERVIEW
  * This is the program tested different interrupt based on pwm.
  * src code:pwminterrupt_v2.c

### STEPS
  * The different type of interrupt are:
    - Rise Interrupt.
    - Fall Interrupt.
    - Half Period Interrupt.
    - Interrupt when Output is disable.

  * To get Rise Interrupt:
    - Make enable Rise Interrupt bits in the control register to get Rise Interrupt.
    - Uncomment the the Rise Interrupt section in the src code to get the Interrupt.

  * To get Fall Interrupt:
    - Make enable Fall Interrupt bits in the control register to get Fall Interrupt.
    - Uncomment the the Fall Interrupt section in the src code to get the Interrupt.

  * To get Half Period Interrupt:
    - Make enable Half Period Interrupt bits in the control register to get Half Period Interrupt.
    - Uncomment the the Half Period Interrupt section in the src code to get the Interrupt.

  * To get Rise Interrupt with O/P disable:  
    - Make enable Rise Interrupt bits and disable output bit in the control register to get Rise Interrupt.
    - Uncomment the the Rise Interrupt with O/P disable section in the src code to get the Interrupt.
    

### RESULTS
  * Set by the code, that board led will toggle when interrupt occurs. 
  * Only interrupt will occur which can be seen through console window.

### Note
  - All the interrupt in the src code checked through PWM_0 pins.
