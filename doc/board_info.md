### Introduction ###

Shakti-sdk aims to provide support for different types of boards. As part of this plan, initially we support two variety of FPGA boards. <br/>
Artix 7 35T board corresponds to E class and Artix 7 100T corresponds to C class. E class of processors are 32 bit cores and C class are 64 bit cores.<br/>
The readme, includes information on installing Vivado, building the bitsream, connecting a JTAG, programming the on-board configuration memory and running example shakti-sdk projects.

### Board information ###
